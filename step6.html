    A. A sheet of paper is then placed under the screen, and with another pass of the squeegee the ink is pushed through those areas of the screen that are not blocked by the stencil, imprinting the design on the paper.

    B. You will need to flood the screen in between passing your prints, in order for the ink to not dry on the screen. If it does you will have to clean and reset. So make sure you have enough ink on the screen and some nearby.

    C. Repeat till you have your desired edition.
