    A. Grab some eye protection.
    Transfer the screen to the sink and use the power washer on low to rinse the surface of the screen. 
    Gently wash the screen first, to get the remaining emulsion to come off. The emulsion covered by the design remains soft and is then washed off, leaving the design on the screen. Leave it to dry in the racks for when youâ€™re ready to print. 

    B.Put your screen back in the vacuum table for about 2 min to harden the emulsion and make for a strong stencil.
