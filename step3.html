<p>
    A.The screen is then placed into an exposure unit that emits UV light. When the exposure unit is on, the design blocks the UV light that hardens the emulsion around the image.

    Bring your acetate film and place it on the glass, then place your screen over top of the design checking that itâ€™s in the right spot for where you want to print. Aim for the middle, too high or too low can make for awkward printing later. 

    
    B. Close the cover, making sure the rope is on top of your screen but away from the design. This helps with suction. 

    Then turn on the unit and the vacuum and exposure should start automatically.
    
    Timer should be set for: 
    12 sec. depending on your image
    
    *WARNING*:
    If your design is going to include more than one color, then a separate screen must be used to apply each layer of ink.
